Q1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  To securly save the work in cloud. Also I want to share the repo with other and allow others to contribute.

Q2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Manual will be more controlled. This is required as to do the update only at the relevent time and one knows the changes happened because of update.
