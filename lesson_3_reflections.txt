Q1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  To securly save the work in cloud. Also I want to share the repo with other and allow others to contribute.

Q2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Manual will be more controlled. This is required as to do the update only at the relevent time and one knows the changes happened because of update.

Q3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork : Fork is a feature provided by github for cloning the repository on the github account
	Clone : Clone the github repository to local
	Branch : A deviation from the master branch with root as master, usually done to start working on different use case/feature or experimental changes

Q4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	This will help in knowing what has changed in the remote and merging

Q5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Over the email. It would be very difficult.
